# 🛒 Retail Price Prediction Model

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Retail Price Prediction Model** is a machine learning project designed to predict the **optimal retail prices** of products based on historical data. The model leverages data-driven insights to help retailers make informed pricing decisions, maximize profits, and optimize inventory management.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the selling price of retail products using the **Retail Price Optimization Dataset** from Kaggle.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Model evaluation using standard performance metrics
- Visualization of predictions and residuals

---

## 🧩 Dataset
**Dataset Name:** Retail Price Optimization Dataset  
**Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)  
**Description:** Contains product-level retail data with features such as category, brand, cost, and pricing attributes used to predict retail prices.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
The following models were implemented and compared:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**

Each model’s performance was evaluated using metrics like:
- **R² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

---

## 📊 Results
- The trained models achieved a strong correlation between predicted and actual prices.
- Visual plots of residuals and feature importance helped identify key price drivers.
- The Random Forest model outperformed Linear Regression in terms of accuracy and generalization.
